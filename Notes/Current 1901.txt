Updating the program to treat region as Objects and not strings.

Regions need their own name attribute, which will presumbaly be stored in the region json files, and thus the generateRegions.py will need updating to add this, then be run again to update the json file.

Class Region has
name: str

There should be a user facing, descriptive name as well as the simpler, gernerated North, East, Central etc taht the program refers to.

Characters will be objects as well, so to be consistent should always be Onjects.

Is there an efficient way to look through the code and find where refactoring needs to happen to this effect? Or just keep running main.py and then debugging until its all done?
