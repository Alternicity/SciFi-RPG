Tomorrow I would like to return to working on motivations, status and gameplay.

Swiz can rob the shop, then talk to someone and their responses do not reflect the fact that he is robbing the shop at gunpoint.

I have a sneaky feeling that createCivilians is running more than once at startup.

Output needs more reduction, but display functions like show_gangs will need testing

Now that Swiz can rob the store, he needs to be able to leave it, then approach an appropriate gang to join.

We can return to Manager Karen gameplay - what does she need to do as a manager of Hannival?

At some point I really need to get on with actual AI, probably beginning with civilians.

I need to check all character classes and ObjectInWorld classes are updated to new specs.

I think hunger/eating needs to be developed, first by visiting cafes and making them functional.
