I would like help optimizing my generators for my python game/sim.
The generators are there to make the components of a city as .json files stored in various folders, *not* create objects.

There is some generator hierarchy:
the main menu call generate.py from the Generate City option.

generate.py calls:
generateRegions.py which makes five city regions with capitalized names like North.json, Central.json, East.json, West.json and South.json, drawing on classes that reside in location.py

generateRegions then calls generateShops.py and generateLocations.py to make Shop and Location objects for those regions based on the regions wealth levels and minimum numbers given in 

regions_with_wealth in region_startup.py
which says how rich each region is
and
location_types_by_wealth in generateRegions.py
which says the minimum of each type of location a given region requires based on the regions wealth.

These shops and locations will be stored in separate folders than the regions. 

the top level generate.py alos calls generateCharacters.py
makes characters as json data files based on classes from characters.py

generateFactions.py
decides on the number of gangs and corporations will be head-quartered in each region then calls generate
generateGangs and generateCorporations.py which creates those json files.

I have not yet decided the optimal place in the generators to associate the gangs and corporations with the HQ locations, but each gang and corporation must be associated with one.

There is then a unique faction called the state, which generateState.py makes json for.

Finally there is generateEnrichment.py which modifies the now existing .json files, adding colour and details and making sure things are set up correctly.
