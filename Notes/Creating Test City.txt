Creating Test City

refactor  
generateFaction, 
Factions.py, goals.py
Gang, Corps 

For each generator first post the appropriate .py file to be first refactored as a @dataclass file.
then refactor the generator.


I am thinking of a hierarchy/sequence of these  generators:

generateFactions Should generate sufficient factions and the state to populate the city, and call:

generateCorps and generateGangs to populate and those factions, adding uniqueness, detail and enmities. 

then:
generateEnrichment (newly added placeholder file)
Will modify existing datafiles.
This stage makes more colorful the CEOs, VIPs, and Bosses from another file, adding characteistics and buffs to the ones that already exist. 
Eventually it might also add colour to locations etc PAUSED FOR 4o


note: there is also a character starting weapons.py that just contains some data.
I'm not sure what to do with it.

Does item.yaml need to be update in light of the updated InWorldObjects.py?
