Creating Test City

generateEnrichment (newly added placeholder file)
Will modify existing datafiles.
This stage makes more colorful the CEOs, VIPs, and Bosses from another file, adding characteistics and buffs to the ones that already exist. 
Eventually it might also add colour to locations 

note: there is also a character starting weapons.py that just contains some data.
I'm not sure what to do with it.

Does item.yaml need to be update in light of the updated InWorldObjects.py?
