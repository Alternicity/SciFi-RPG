Output and program flow are looking good again.
I'd just like to pause to say thankyou chat.

Program runs, and several menu options work.

Things for us to look at:
Only 1 employee seems to be getting created.
The 1 employee has no name, judging by this output line
DEBUG: Assigned Unknown Unknown to Shop in SouthVille


DEBUG: Searching for 'Municipal Building' in game_state.all_locations...
WARNING: Could not find specified location 'Municipal Building'.

Sending the test character to the only shop with an employee and taking the display employees menu option I get
DEBUG: Display Employees function called for Shop in Easternhole
DEBUG: Display Employees called for Shop in Easternhole
DEBUG: location object ID: 2674814368848

NameError: name 'shops' is not defined

game_state has a self.shops = []
which as it stands can only really be a list of all shops in the game.
In the original program flow, and preferably now, gameplay will interact with region objects, which will have their own lists of locations and shops, and update game_state.
game_state, an object to provide variables globally was created to solve problems with passing variables between functions and files, but I dont want to put everything in there ideally.
