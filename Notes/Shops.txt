Shops
My character is able to enter a shop.
Typical output:
Karen enters Shop in Downtown.
Shop in Downtown has no items available.
After which gameplay is currently called, as the gameplay menu is displayed.
Instead of displaying the gameplay menu a new menu should display, allowing access to the shops inventory and other options.

There are several tasks
1 Make sure employees are generated, have names and are distributed to locations, ensuring shops get some. The current "show employees" menu option doesnt work.
2 Make sure shop and inventory code is connected.
3 Make sure the inventory has a few ObjectInWorld objects.
4 Make available the buy item function to the player
