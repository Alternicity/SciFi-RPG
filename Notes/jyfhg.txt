I have not located the dictionary .name bug that is causing the pre menu output:
Error during initialization: 'dict' object has no attribute 'name'

Is there a way to search the codebase for this?

Also, generate.py is being called automatically at startup. Is there a way to serach the code for calls to generate.py?
The print line reporting it is in generate.py itself.
Also, why are all the other python lines getting printed out?

Pre menu terminal output:
Running generate.py from: C:\Users\Stuart\Python Scripts\scifiRPG
sys.path: ['c:\\Users\\Stuart\\Python Scripts\\scifiRPG', 'C:\\Users\\Stuart\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313\\python313.zip', 'C:\\Users\\Stuart\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313\\DLLs', 'C:\\Users\\Stuart\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313\\Lib', 'C:\\Users\\Stuart\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313', 'C:\\Users\\Stuart\\Python Scripts\\scifiRPG\\.venv', 'C:\\Users\\Stuart\\Python Scripts\\scifiRPG\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages']
