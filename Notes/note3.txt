As gangs, corps/corporations and the state are all factions, I am considering making their generators a hierarchy, like regions>locations/shops.

So, generate will call generateFactions, which will call generateGangs and generateCorps, and maybe a new generateState.

Corps and Gangs must be associated with an HQ location, and their json make note of this, plus HQ json locations must have a variable updated to show which gang or corporation resides there.

The State will have it's own HQ which must be defined as a class in locations.py; something like MunicipalBuilding.
Also it must have some other locations specific to it that ust be created as locations classes, then json via generateState.py, like garbageCollectionCentre and TaxOffice, and Police Station.

Also needed in characters.py is Classes: Detective, Taxman, GarbageCollector, StateDoctor, and StateNurse.


When display regions show their wealth levels and maybe key features.
