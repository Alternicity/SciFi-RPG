The Class create_character_if_needed contains this line:
character_registry[entity_id] = character

Could this be the the cause of the problem?

My understanding of this line is that it is looking at the entry in the list character_registry for the entity_id and assigning character to it?

Doesn't the character_registry need to be a dictionary of key value pairs?
Each entry being a entity_id paired with a character name?
