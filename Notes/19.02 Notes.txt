create_all_characters() is called twice, and I am deciding which call should be deleted.


There is a simple wrapper function called character_creation_funcs that does nothing but call it. I have commented it out










locations and location_objects appear to tbe the same thing

class Character will ned to have an attentionattribute, which dynamically updates a list of what is on their mind.
