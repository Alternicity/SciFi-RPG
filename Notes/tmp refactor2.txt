When I last asked if you remembered our current task you put it like this

We're working on refactoring character-related classes to:

Ensure proper handling of kwargs to prevent TypeError issues from unexpected arguments.
Standardize class initialization by ensuring consistent super().__init__() calls.
Fix multiple values for arguments like loyalties and inventory while keeping defaults flexible.
Ensure correct attribute extraction from kwargs, avoiding potential conflicts.
Improve consistency across all character subclasses (e.g., CEO, Boss, Captain, etc.).
Retain dynamic motivation updates using update_motivations() to ensure motivations align with character needs.

Replace Old Region/Location References with whereabouts
We need to update all instances of character.current_region, character.current_location, and similar attributes.



Instead of setting current_region and current_location separately, make sure new characters follow the whereabouts model.
Gameplay (gameplay.py)

Before:
python
Copy
Edit
character.current_region = region.name
if character.faction and character.faction.HQ:
    character.current_location = character.faction.HQ
After:
python
Copy
Edit
character.current_region = region.name
character.current_location = character.faction.HQ if character.faction and character.faction.HQ else None
print(f"\n{character.name} is in {character.whereabouts}.")
Display (display.py)

Already uses whereabouts ✅
Just check that no functions are manually concatenating current_region + ", " + current_location.

3️⃣ Handle Character Initialization (VIP, Civilian, etc.)
The original error (VIP.__init__() missing start_location) suggests that characters are being initialized with separate region/location arguments.

We should ensure all characters use whereabouts consistently.
Change start_location to current_location when initializing characters.
For example:

Before
python
Copy
Edit
class VIP(Civilian):
    def __init__(self, name, start_location, **kwargs):
        kwargs.setdefault("faction", "The State")
        super().__init__(name, start_location=start_location, **kwargs)
After
python
Copy
Edit
class VIP(Civilian):
    def __init__(self, name, current_region, current_location=None, **kwargs):
        kwargs.setdefault("faction", "The State")
        self.current_region = current_region
        self.current_location = current_location
        super().__init__(name, **kwargs)
This ensures that all character types follow the new location model.
