Long-Term Strategy for Managing Growing Codebases
(A) Modularize Everything
Separate concerns into clearly defined modules:
generate_* → Only writes JSON (data generation)
create_* → Only loads JSON & creates objects (game runtime)
store_* → Only updates JSON when the game state changes
(B) Prune Unused or Redundant Code ("Via Negativa")
Keep the codebase minimal and remove:
Old commented-out sections (unless needed for debugging)
Functions that duplicate functionality
(C) Improve Documentation
Each function should answer:
What does this function do?
What data does it use?
What does it return?
Docstrings should assume the next person reading the code knows nothing.
