I would like to add an option to the gameplaz menu:
Think.
This will print statements based on the characters motivations, and have hooks to draw on memories and other functions, yet to be written, like psy related (if the charcter has a sufficiently high psy attribute), and nudges to the player.

A secondary, in depth Character Details option that becomes a gameplay menu option (for one menu only, if it is not selected, the next time gameplay menu is shown, it will have disappeard).
This option will Offer 
View full Inventory
View all motivations
View full Character Details
This last one will display the characters attributes in full, in tabular format.

Shops shoudl be either corporate owned or family owned.
