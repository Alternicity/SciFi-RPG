To Do 0103

Your InWorldObjects.py file is shaping up well, but I see a few areas for improvement:

Enum Usage Consistency:

In CashWad, you used toughness="Fragile" and size="Pocket Sized", but you defined Toughness and Size as Enums.
Instead, use Toughness.FRAGILE and Size.POCKET_SIZED.
Inheritance & Code Duplication:

CashWad, HardDrive, and other items should inherit from ObjectInWorld properly.
You repeat damage_points, legality, and blackmarket_value in multiple places. Consider defining a MarketableItem mixin.
Fix Pistol Class:

You have range=50, at the end of the Pistol constructor. Thatâ€™s an unnecessary trailing assignment.
Item Interactions & Expanding ObjectInWorld:

The broadcast_actions method from InWorldObject is a good approach! You could integrate it into ObjectInWorld so that each item knows its available interactions.
