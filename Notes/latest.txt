Would you like help designing a simple character selection function that fits within your current structure?



This is currently handled in display.py main_menu()
snippet:
def main_menu():
    """Display the main menu and handle user choices."""
    while True:
        print("\n=== Main Menu ===")
        print("1: Play/Test Game")

        print("6: Exit")
        
        try:
            choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))
            if choice == 1:
                # move this game logic, calling `character_and_region_selection` to a gameplay file
                characters = player_character_options() 
                
                if selected_character and region:
                    return selected_character, region  # Return for gameplay flow   

This worked before but several things are now marked by pylance as undefined:
player_character_options
selected_character
and
region
