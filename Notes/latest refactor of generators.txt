Refactoring/creating generator classes, several remain.
GenerateFactions.py needs to be created. It will create: The State, then call generateCorps.py, and generateGangs.py

#initial Poulation calculation based on Regions, locations etc, get_region_wealth
    #poorer areas have more gangs, richer ones more corps
    #minimum population levels per region
    #factor in gang/corp/state representation in region
    #create also transient population/wanderers
    #Add an iteration mechanism like for each region, make these charcters
    #Read region and, shop and location data
    #for each Corporate store create
    #this generator must be codeed in tandem with generateFactions
    #Factions create Factions Objects, and these create  required character lists, 
    #and generateCharacters.py createes these characters, associating them with those factions.
    #Faction memebers default to starting in their Faction HQ
    #This generator also needs to assign starting loyalties to characters, which needs to be refactored
    #to be a dictionary or other data structure and include entries for loyalty to who, what, a quantity, and public/secret nature of that loyalty.



Classes in location.py
Location Base class, abstract
HQ(Location) each gang or corp needs one
Vendor(Location) Abstract
Shop(Vendor) concrete, common
CorporateStore(Vendor) concrete, 1-2 per corp
RepairWorkshop(Location) concrete
MechanicalRepairWorkshop(RepairWorkshop) concrete
ElectricalRepairWorkshop(RepairWorkshop) concrete
Stash(Location) hidden, associated with a gang, concrete
Factory(Location) concrete
Nightclub(Location) concrete
Mine(Location) concrete
Powerplant(Location) concrete
Airport(Location) concrete, rare
Port(Location) concrete, cannot be in central region
Factory(Location) concete
Cafe(Location) concrete
Park(Location) concrete

generateFactions should decide the number of gangs and corps based on the region. 2-3 gangs and 4-6 corps. It must associate a gang/corp with an HQ, and call generateGangs and generateCorps, all of which update test_city.json

state.py does not yet exist

gameplay mode where player controls a low ranking character of a faction, but the Boss/CEO of taht factions trusts them and is vebose, exposing the workings of the GOAP and news/events to the plahyer.
