We were refactoring/creating generator classes, several remain.
GenerateFactions.py needs to be created. It will create: The State, then call generateCorps.py, and generateGangs.py

generateCorps will generate sufficient corporations to populate test_city.json
and will draw on the relevant .py files I will post you.

generateGangs will draw on the relevant .py files I post you and create gangs to populate the test_city.yaml

generateCivilians.py will create a civilian population.
generateFactions will need to import and draw from generateRegion to know the scale and territory factors, and maybe gangs and corps will each need to be associated with an HQ(Location), defined in location.py and locations.json
Let's work systematically, one generator at a time, starting with GenerateFactions.py

generateRegion.py
generateCorps.py
generateGangs.py
location.py 
locations.json
test_city.json
State.py



Classes in location.py
Location Base class, abstract
HQ(Location) each gang or corp needs one
Vendor(Location) Abstract
Shop(Vendor) concrete, common
CorporateStore(Vendor) concrete, 1-2 per corp
RepairWorkshop(Location) concrete
MechanicalRepairWorkshop(RepairWorkshop) concrete
ElectricalRepairWorkshop(RepairWorkshop) concrete
Stash(Location) hidden, associated with a gang, concrete
Factory(Location) concrete
Nightclub(Location) concrete
Mine(Location) concrete
Powerplant(Location) concrete
Airport(Location) concrete, rare
Port(Location) concrete, cannot be in central region
Factory(Location) concete
Cafe(Location) concrete
Park(Location) concrete

generateFactions should decide the number of gangs and corps based on the region. 2-3 gangs and 42-5 corps. It must associate a gang/corp with an HQ, and call generateGangs and generateCorps, all of which update test_city.json

state.py does not yet exist, state.yaml is small:
name: "The State"
type: "corporation"
affiliation: "none"
resources: 10000
laws: ["Law 1", "Law 2", "Law 3"]
goals:
  - goal: "retain dominance"
    priority: "high"
    reward: 2000
  - goal: "extract value"
    priority: "high"
    reward: 1500
