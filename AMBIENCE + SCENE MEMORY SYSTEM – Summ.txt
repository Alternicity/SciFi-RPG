🧠 AMBIENCE + SCENE MEMORY SYSTEM – Summary & Prompt
📜 Overview
You’ve now integrated a system where:

Every Location has an Ambience field (peace, curiosity, etc.).

Each Character absorbs ambience based on their psy attribute.

A peak vibe (the most dominant emotion in the space) is logged.

Nearby social context (friends, enemies, others) is also captured.

This data is stored into semantic["ambient_vibes"] per character.

Thoughts are optionally generated: “This place feels peaceful.”

🧠 PROMPT TO RE-ENGAGE DEVELOPMENT
Use the following to jump back in:

“Help me extend the ambience → memory system into emergent narrative generation.
How can I use ambient_vibes + social context to generate scene memories, poetic reflections, or mood-based decisions?
Could certain vibes trigger daydreams, flashbacks, or corollary thoughts in Luna?”

🪞 Optional Prompts for Emergent Stories
1. “Scene Diaries” Prompt:

“Build a small diary system where characters reflect on recent high-vibe locations.
Let Luna write a symbolic entry about a memory from a peaceful, friend-filled scene.”

2. “Mood-Driven Flashback” Prompt:

“If Luna absorbs a peak vibe of ‘melancholy’ in a quiet room—can she dream of a moment she forgot?
Prototype a dream-spawned Thought object triggered by ambient memory reactivation.”

3. “Social Resonance Reactions” Prompt:

“Can two characters absorbing the same ambience form a temporary bond or insight?
Let shared vibes lead to mutual memory entries or emergent friendships.”
