    """ keep urgent() in Mind.
Heres why:
The mind owns the thoughts and should manage querying/filtering them.
It respects the Single Responsibility Principle: GangMemberAI can ask 
the mind for urgent thoughts but shouldnt know how to filter them.
Keeps AI logic decoupled from low-level data structure logic. 
If AI needs more complex logic, you can subclass or extend it â€” but basic filtering is a data responsibility."""
